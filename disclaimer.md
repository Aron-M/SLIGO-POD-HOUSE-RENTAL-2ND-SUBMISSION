# DISCLAIMER

I apologize in advance for handing in an incomplete README. My first mistake was leaving the README for the end instead of doing it in the beginning or as I progressed in building my web page.

The reason I am late with this, purely just being caught up between my day job and this past week being in the hospital for many hours a day with the complicated birth of my newborn son. Time had cauht up on me and I will own up to that.

On the hand, I still am fairly happy with my web page apart from a couple of styling errors here and there, however I believe it will be enough for a passing grade. I will finish my README over the course of this weekend regardless, in order to become better acquainted with how to write README files. If you wish to still see it post submission, I would gladly send it on first thing.

Again I apologize in advance and do let me know if there is anything I can do regarding this matter.

Kind regards
